Hellurei, my friends. It's Pekkis here.

I promised to send preparation instructions for the React training a week in advance, so here we are.

It is very important to follow these instructions _before_ the training day so we don't lose precious time on pre-setup.

Start by joining the Discord (link below) server. I would recommend the desktop version of the software.

https://discord.gg/HeW9qc3kF (This link should be alive for 30 days)

After you have joined, you can clone / fork the following repo and set the coding environment up.

https://github.com/pekkis/hardcore-react-training

Follow the instructions in the README.md carefully. Make sure you get the site up and running BEFORE THE TRAINING SESSION. Also make sure that you start LiveShare in VSCode once (it requires logging in at the first startup). If you encounter errors that you can't solve, poke me in the Discord channel you joined.

If you want to use some other IDE / editor than VSCode, you'll miss out on LiveShare and that could be a useful tool here. So maybe you really ought to use VSCode this time even if you like your usual IDE better.

See you at the server, and hey, you must **pull the latest changes** in the morning before the session and run `pnpm i`. I'm sure I'll still do R & D and update the repo somehow with something, update the packages and / or apply some latest wizardy / weirdness.

We'll start both days at 0900 hours and end at ~1600ish hours.

Cheers,

Pekkis
