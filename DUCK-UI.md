# Duck UI

Ducks tend to like plump corners and lots of padding. The customer requires a robust design system to support Duck Economist for years to come!

It _must_ have a Storybook that Gaylord can show to investors!

## Design Tokens

- They already live in theme (or some CSS variable file). Expand as necessary.

## Button

- primary (default) and secondary (alternate action) variants!
- option: expand to fill inline of container
- Some kind of nice CSS transition / animashuun to hover!

## Input

- Must conform to general Duck UI requirements!

## Textarea

- Must conform to general Duck UI requirements!

## Progress

- Must conform to general Duck UI requirements!

## SectionHeading

- Might be a good candidate to abstract section headers

## Layout components

- Maybe there's room for some generic reusable components.
